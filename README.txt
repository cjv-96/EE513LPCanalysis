The script main.m implements part 1 and calls whisperme(), which implements parts 2-4. The help file 
for whisperme details how to change the functionality of whisperme using a flag "wp". This script uses the
the script I wrote for Project 1 to produce an error sequence to filter using the LPC analysis of of a speech 
signal.

KNOWN BUGS
-------------
1) Part 4 is not functional. It can be seen, when run, that the reconstructed signal has the same
	envelope as the original signal, but it only sounds like the pentatonic scale with distortion.
